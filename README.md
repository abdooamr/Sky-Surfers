This project showcases the use of Three.js to build a basic 3D game environment. The game includes a moving sphere that the player controls through the arrow keys while avoiding obstacles generated in the scene.

## Features

- **3D Environment:** Utilizes Three.js to create a visually engaging 3D game environment.
- **Dynamic Obstacles:** Randomly generated cubes serve as obstacles that the player must navigate around.
- **Scoring System:** Tracks the player's progress with a scoring mechanism.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
